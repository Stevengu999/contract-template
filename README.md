# Contract template
Clean contract template with right environment.

## Dependencies
This repository uses [Truffle](http://truffleframework.com/) to compile, test and deploy smart contracts. 

Also running node with active json-rpc is required. For testing puproses we suggest using [TestRPC](https://github.com/ethereumjs/testrpc).
We strongly recommend you to use latest **node**, **npm**, and **yarn** versions.

The environment can be set up by command:
`./serve/install_env.sh`

For more information about Truffle visit [https://truffle.readthedocs.io/en/latest/](https://truffle.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).

## Usage

`./serve/run_testrpc.sh` - run testrpc<br />
`./serve/run_tests.sh` - run tests
